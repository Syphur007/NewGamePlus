**NEW+GAME** Code of Conduct

Our Vision \& Mission



Hello, I am a 4.0 Undergrad student working towards a Bachelors in Computer Science/Gaming Development and this is a side project that has been stuck in my head for 7 years now, but I did not have the means to make it a reality until now.  AI has changed the game for a creators but there is one minor problem as I am not a coder and I have very little coding experience with a degree in CNET that has been collecting dust for over 15 years.  So I am asking for anyone's help and some possible partners as I have a patent pending on the App and the top ten matching tech so you can rest assured we can turn this into something spectacular.  I will be here every step of the way for any questions or concerns.  Sky is the limit.  It is really far along but I feel like I'm missing something that I think someone out there can fill that void and I am all in.  I have much of the app built and working but I'm looking for that person with that idea that will bring us home.....I am only one man and I sure as hell can do it on my own.





  Welcome to ***NEW+GAME*** - a revolutionary gaming partnership platform that's been 7 years in the making. This project represents a dream turned reality through the power of AI and collaborative development. With my patent-pending **Top Ten List™ (TTL)** matching technology, we're creating something truly special for the gaming community.  To sum it all up,  I have a patent pending on an app I created that has users create a profile the add any 1-10 game titles along with hours of game play then searches for matches with the same game and hours forming an instant connections between players and there is nothing out there that does that but that is just the beginning and I feel like my time, our time is now.  I have incorporated some other things as well but you will have to look for yourself



As a solo founder who believes that "one person can't do it all," I'm incredibly grateful to have talented developers join this exciting journey. Together, we're building the future of gaming connections.  I'm willing to share and I am open to anything you just have to ask or communicate.  I feel there is one or more person out there, who could take this project to the next level.
